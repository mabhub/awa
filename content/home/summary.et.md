The implementation of an adaptation strategy is a real learning process in which a progressive advance respecting several steps is necessary. First, defining and understanding the vulnerability of farming is a necessary prerequisite for any adaptation process. 
It is imperative to identify the weaknesses and / or climatic forces of the agricultural system currently deployed and to be aware of what climate change is and its agricultural impacts.

In a second step, agro-climatic projections for the near future period will offer a reading of new climate opportunities and / or threats defining the new context of the farm. 
The implementation of an adaptation strategy must therefore envisage improving climate weaknesses and threats to the farm, by mobilizing levers for a wide range of vulnerability components. 
Planning for adaptation measures must then be carried out to distinguish what can be implemented in the short, medium or long term.
