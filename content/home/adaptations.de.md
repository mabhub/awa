This module is devoted to sustainable adaptation measures that can be envisaged at farm scale. The agro-climatic vulnerability of a farm often depends on several climatic factors, so it is necessary to imagine the implementation of differentiated adaptation measures. 
Thus, for each of the 3 agricultural systems studied, sustainable adaptation measures are classified according to 4 components of farm vulnerability. For example, in arable crops, the measures proposed will seek to improve the resilience of the cropping system, the varieties cultivated, the water dependency or even the soil and farming practices.
The implementation of a strategy for sustainable adaptation to climate change takes place over time. 

The proposed measures are therefore distinguished according to the possibility of implementation in the short, medium or long term. For each adaptation measure, it is possible to know more by a simple click: a summary sheet then appears, offering an overview of its overall durability through its possible impact (neutral, positive or adverse) on a set of 9 components: emission of greenhouse gases, air quality, soil, water etc.
The sustainable adaptation measures are specific to each of the 4 climate zones proposed. For each zone, the measures are systematically available in English as well as in the language of the country it represents.
