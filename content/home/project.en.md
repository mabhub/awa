One of the main challenges facing the world, and the agricultural sector in particular, is climate change. 
Even if some of the changes in climate could be beneficial for some European agricultural production, most of the changes have had negative impacts and disproportionately affect regions already concerned by other environmental problems. 
European farmers have and will have to adapt to a changing climate, through measures that go beyond simple adjustments to ad hoc practices. In order to limit the vulnerability of their farms to increasingly variable climatic hazards, adaptation must first of all be designed and undertaken in a sustainable manner.

It was in this context that the **European AgriAdapt project** was born, 
supported by the LIFE program of the European Commission. 
It brings together French, Spanish, German and Estonian partners, 
who represent four areas constrained by different climatic risks.

The objective of the AgriAdapt project is twofold: 
to **assess the vulnerability** of the main European agricultural products to climate change; but also to propose **sustainable adaptation plans** allowing these systems to become more resilient. 
This AgriAdapt webtool for Adaptation aims to highlight the main results of the monitoring of more than 120 pilot farms in 4 countries, by sharing them with the largest number of users in Europe. 

The discovery of 3 successive modules is proposed to strengthen its agroclimatic knowledge and be able to support more resilient agriculture.
