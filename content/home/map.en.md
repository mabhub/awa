This module consists of a map entry proposing the consultation of agronomic (yields) and climatic (observations and projections) data for different geographic locations throughout Europe.

Just move the map to the area of interest, then zoom in to more accurately identify the place you are flying over. Each small orange square (or grid point) on the map then lets you view local data with a single click.

For each grid point, a compilation of annual yields from different crops (2000-2017 period) first shows the variability in performance in terms of yields. Then, the description of the past climate (observations for the period 1987-2016) is presented through different graphs for several variables: temperature, precipitation, number of days of freezing, etc. 
Finally, climate projections illustrate in the form of 10 graphs the climate changes for the near future period (2017-2046), then supplemented by 19 agro-climatic indicators specific to cereals, fodder, animals, vineyards and orchards.
