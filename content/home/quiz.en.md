Through around thirty different questions, you will be able to test your knowledge of climate change, agricultural impacts of the climate on different agricultural productions and possible adaptation measures at farm scale.

4 different quizzes are offered, each corresponding to the geographic location of the 4 countries involved in the project (France, Germany, Spain and Estonia), all representative of a major climatic influence in Europe: Mediterranean, Atlantic, continental, and Nordic areas. Each quiz is systematically available in English as well as in the language of the country it represents.

For each question, one or more correct answers are possible among the 4 proposals. Just click on your choice (only one possible) to know if your answer is correct. An explanation will then appear at the bottom of the screen and you can deepen the subject even further if you wish by clicking on "Learn more".

At any time during the quiz, you can continue to the next question if you do not wish to answer any of the questions. Once the quiz is finished, a summary will indicate the number of correct answers obtained for each of the 3 categories: climate change, agricultural impacts and adaptation measures.
