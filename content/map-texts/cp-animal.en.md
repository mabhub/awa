The following agro climatic indicators are all devoted to **animal
management**. 

The possible changes in climate conditions are illustrated
through **3 indicators**: heat stress risk for cattle, heating and cooling
needs for animal buildings.

Like the climate general indicators, the simulations offer a reading of the
**Recent Past** (i.e. the past 30 years) as well as the **Near Future** (i.e.
the next 30 years). By comparison, it is then possible to observe changes
(extreme values, averages, etc.).
