A climate is described by a set of climatic variables (temperatures, rainfall, etc.) over a period of **at least 30 years**, the time necessary to glimpse the variability and changes in certain parameters.

The **cumulative rainfall (mm)** is available for the period **1987-2016**.

The results are presented for **an entire calendar year**, then by season
according to the following approach: **winter** (January - February - March),
**spring** (April - May - June), **summer** (July - August - September) and
finally **autumn** (October - November - December).

For each graphical representation, the detail of the annual value is available by a simple hover with the cursor. Thus, you will be able to frame the **minimum** and **maximum** values of the proposed time series, but also **identify possible developments** over the period.
