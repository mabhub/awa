A climate is described by a set of climatic variables (temperatures, rainfall, etc.) over a period of **at least 30 years**, the time necessary to glimpse the variability and changes in certain parameters.

Here is the number of days per year with **maximum temperatures exceeding 25Â°C** for the
period **1987-2016**.

The detail of the annual value is available by a simple hover with the cursor on the graph. Thus, you will be able to frame the **minimum** and **maximum** values of the proposed time series, but also **identify possible developments** over the period.
