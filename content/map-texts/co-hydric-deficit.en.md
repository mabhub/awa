The **water deficit (or balance)** is calculated by the difference between
rainfall and potential evapotranspiration over a given period. The values (mm)
here cover the period **1986-2016**.

The results are presented for **an entire calendar year**, then by season
according to the following approach: **winter** (January - February - March),
**spring** (April - May - June), **summer** (July, August, September) and
finally **autumn** (October November December).

For each representation, the **minimum**, **maximum** values and the **median**
are summarized.
