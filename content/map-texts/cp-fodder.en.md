The following agro climatic indicators are all devoted to **fodder**.

The possible changes in agronomic conditions are illustrated through **3
indicators**: Day of beginning of grass regrowth, first day of early mowing
(silage) or summer drought.

Like the climate general indicators, the simulations offer a reading of the
**Recent Past** (i.e. the past 30 years) as well as the **Near Future** (i.e.
the next 30 years). By comparison, it is then possible to observe changes
(extreme values, averages, etc.).
