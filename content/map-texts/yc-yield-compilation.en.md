The yield level of a crop can be extremely variable from one year to another,
even for the same geographic locality. To see this variability, it is necessary
to use **yield compilations over several years**.

Below, the average annual yields of different categories of crops are compiled
from the **harvest 2000 to harvest 2017**. A color gradient ranging from green to
red helps to detect visually the level of **annual performance**. For the worst
years appearing in red, it is then possible to wonder about the limiting
climatic factors as well as their current trends.

**Sources for yields:**
**Estonia** (Statistics Estonia), 
**France** (Agreste, SAA), 
**Germany** (Statistische Landes√§mter),
**Spain** (MAPA), 
**Other countries** (FAO Stat)
