You will now discover **climate projections** that characterize the climate of the next 30 years, period corresponding to the **Near Future** (NF). These projections come from climate models simulating the climate and its possible evolution (Agri4Cast, JRC).
A first series of general indicators describe the variables of this climate for the NF. Then, it is possible to browse more specific indicators, shedding light on the conditions of field arable crop production, fodder production, livestock management, and production of perennial plants (vineyards and fruits).

The following agro climatic indicators are all devoted to **arable crops**:
straw cereals, summer crops (corn, sunflower, sugar beets), rapeseed.

The possible changes in agronomic conditions are illustrated through **9
indicators**: shriveling, risk of frost, drought, harvest accessibility, etc.

Like the climate general indicators, the simulations offer a reading of the
**Recent Past** (i.e. the past 30 years) as well as the **Near Future** (i.e.
the next 30 years). By comparison, it is then possible to observe changes
(extreme values, averages, etc.).
