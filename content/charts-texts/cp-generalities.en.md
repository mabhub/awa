The **possible changes in the climate** are offered through graphical
representations of **several climatic variables**: rainfall, average annual
temperature, water deficit, sum of temperatures, number of hot or cold days per
year, etc.

On each graph, the simulations offer a reading of the **Recent Past** (i.e. the
past 30 years) as well as the **Near Future** (i.e. the next 30 years). By
comparison, it is then possible to observe changes (extreme values, averages,
etc.).
