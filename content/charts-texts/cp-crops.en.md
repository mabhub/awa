The following agro climatic indicators are all devoted to **arable crops**:
straw cereals, summer crops (corn, sunflower, sugar beets), rapeseed.

The possible changes in agronomic conditions are illustrated through **9
indicators**: shriveling, risk of frost, drought, harvest accessibility, etc.

Like the climate general indicators, the simulations offer a reading of the
**Recent Past** (i.e. the past 30 years) as well as the **Near Future** (i.e.
the next 30 years). By comparison, it is then possible to observe changes
(extreme values, averages, etc.).
