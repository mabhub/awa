  "explanation": "Maximum temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius during the grain-filling phase in cereals may lead to wrinkled grains, lower weight and low yields, a phenomena known as shrivelling.",

Similar effects have also been attributed as one of the main causes for the **lack of yield increase** of winter wheat in France despite improvements in crop breeding.\n\nDuring the 2003 and 2010 heat waves, grain-harvest losses reached **20%** in affected regions in Europe. Cereals productions fell on average by **40%** in the Iberian Peninsula in 2004/2005 (IPCC, 2014).\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/solagro/image/upload/v1583512901/learn_more/FGN20_pv0b2w.png \"Impact on agricultural production 2003 and financial impact. Adapted from UNEP/DEWA (2004); data from COPA-COGECA (2003)\")\n\n**Shrivelling of the grain** occurs during the last third of the ripening period, when dry and hot winds are present. Water circulation in plants becomes difficult, the desiccation produced by wind cannot be counteracted, and the drying out of grain is anticipated, getting the grains wrinkled and losing weight.\n\nIn order to prevent shrivelling, water reserves in the soil must be increased and drought resistant varieties used, especially early varieties which can ripen before the hot and dry winds show up. \n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/solagro/image/upload/v1583512983/learn_more/FGN21_wp1uoo.png \"Effects of dry and hot winds in the last third of the wheat cycle \")\n\nSource: Baseline Report AgriAdapt and Infoagro\n\n<https://agriadapt.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/A1_Baseline-report_Full-version_V3.pdf>\n\n<https://www.infoagro.com/herbaceos/cereales/trigo3.htm>"
